# Lazor_Project
This will be a program that automatically finds solutions to the "Lazor" game on iOS and Andriod.


Within this project we: 
* Analyze bff file content
* Create laser movement logic
* Define block classes to define the how blocks will interact with the laser
* TODO: Solve the different levels automatically under 2 minutes
* Generated an output format to show the original level and the solved level
